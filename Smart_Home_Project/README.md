# Smart Home System README

## Overview

This project presents a Smart Home System implemented with the collaboration of a dedicated team. The system utilizes two microcontrollers (Atmega32), an array of hardware components, and various peripherals to create a versatile and efficient home automation solution.

## Features

- **Microcontrollers**: The system is powered by two Atmega32 microcontrollers, offering robust processing power and versatility for managing home automation tasks.
- **Hardware Components**: The system incorporates a range of hardware components including EEPROM, LED, relay, LCD, RTC (Real-Time Clock), keypad, DC motor, LDR sensor, LM35 sensor, WiFi module, and fingerprint module.
- **Peripherals**: A variety of peripherals such as DIO (Digital Input/Output), PORT, USART (Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter), I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), EXTI (External Interrupt), TIMER0, TIMER1, and ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) are employed for interfacing and controlling the connected devices.

## Functionality

The Smart Home System offers the following functionalities:

- **Home Security**: Utilizing the fingerprint module for secure access control and the LDR sensor for detecting changes in ambient light levels, the system ensures robust home security measures.
- **Temperature Control**: With the LM35 sensor, the system monitors ambient temperature, allowing for automated temperature control and regulation.
- **User Interface**: The LCD and keypad provide an intuitive user interface for interacting with the system, enabling users to set preferences and monitor system status.
- **Real-Time Clock**: The RTC module ensures accurate timekeeping, facilitating scheduled tasks and event management within the system.
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Leveraging the WiFi module, the system can connect to wireless networks, enabling remote access and control via mobile devices or web interfaces.
